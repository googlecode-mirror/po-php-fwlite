Most PHP frameworks are Object-Oriented. But for me, I think the most effective way is the traditional way for this language. So, Process-Oriented will be more reasonable for PHP.
And this framework has run for our project for about 4 years and for above 10 projects.
We have confidence that this framework will be more simple and directly.
